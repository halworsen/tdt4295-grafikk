Bugge is an embedded system designed from absolute scratch, and is capable of drawing arbitrarily complex 3D wireframe models with VGA output. An onboard EFM32GG microcontroller receives inputs and communicates shapes to a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA for graphics acceleration. Bugge was developed for the course TDT4295 (Datamaskinprosjekt/Computer project) at NTNU in the fall semester of 2021.

The project is separated into 3 independent parts:
* Electrical schematics & PCB routing
* Microcontroller code
* FPGA code
